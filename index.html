      <h3>Why I joined Alt School</h3>
      <p>
        HAving being in the tech field for some time and seeing how fast things
        are changing in this tech ecosystem, I forsee a future were AI will take
        over alot of jobs such as frontend, backend, design and a whole lots
        more. So i thought that it will be nice if I learn something that will
        still be relevant when that time comes and thats why i Choos to learn
        cloud engineering. I chosed ALT school because of the stories i have
        heard from past students and how convenient it will be for me knowing
        that I do not have a computer science background.
      </p>
